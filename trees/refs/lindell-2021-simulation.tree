\p{One of the most fundamental notions of cryptography is that of simulation. It
stands behind the concepts of semantic security, zero knowledge, and security
for multiparty computation. However, writing a simulator and proving security
via the use of simulation is a non-trivial task, and one that many newcomers to
the field often find difficult. In this tutorial, we provide a guide to how to
write simulators and prove security via the simulation paradigm. Although we
have tried to make this tutorial as stand-alone as possible, we assume some
familiarity with the notions of secure encryption, zero-knowledge, and secure
computation.}
