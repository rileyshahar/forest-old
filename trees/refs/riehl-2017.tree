\p{Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics,
the text provides tools for understanding and attacking difficult problems in
algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. Drawing upon
a broad range of mathematical examples from the categorical perspective, the
author illustrates how the concepts and constructions of category theory arise
from and illuminate more basic mathematical ideas. Prerequisites are limited to
familiarity with some basic set theory and logic.}
