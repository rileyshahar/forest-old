\p{We introduce basic category theory and construct the fundamental groupoid of
a topological space. Using homotopy as an analogy, we define natural
transformations and equivalence of categories. We conclude with the homotopy
invariance of the fundamental groupoid and a sketch of strict 2-categories.}
