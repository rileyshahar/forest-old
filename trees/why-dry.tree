\p{[DRY](dry) has several benefits, including:}

\ul{
	\li{Modifiability: if it turns out that the requirements of a project change,
	with code repetition you'd need to change all occurances of the code.}
	\li{Error proneness: if one of our repeated copies of the same code had a
	typo, it would be very difficult to catch and debug.}
  \li{Readability: DRY makes it easier to identify common occurance in the code.}
}
